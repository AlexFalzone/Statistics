        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Glivenko-Cantelli Theorems</strong> is a fundamental result in probability
          theory that establishes the convergence properties of the empirical
          cumulative distribution function (ECDF) to the true cumulative
          distribution function (CDF). As the sample size increases, the ECDF
          converges uniformly to the CDF, providing insights into the behavior
          of sample-based estimators.
        </p>

        <h4>The Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem::</h4>
        <p>
          The theorem states that, for any true cumulative distribution function
          F and corresponding empirical counterpart Fn based on n independent
          and identically distributed samples, the maximum difference between Fn
          and F converges to zero almost surely as n approaches infinity.
        </p>

        <h4>Proof and Concept:</h4>
        <p>
          he proof involves showing that, as the sample size grows, the suprema
          of the absolute differences between the empirical and true cumulative
          distribution functions tend to zero with high probability. This result
          has profound implications, highlighting the consistency of
          sample-based estimators in approximating the true underlying
          distribution.

          This script provides a hands-on illustration of the Glivenkoâ€“Cantelli
          Theorem, emphasizing its significance in understanding the convergence
          properties of empirical estimates to true distribution functions.
