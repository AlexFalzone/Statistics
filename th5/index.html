        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>
          Statistical distributions are foundational in probability theory and
          statistical analysis, categorized broadly into continuous and discrete
          distributions. Understanding their properties and simulating their
          behavior is essential for statisticians and data scientists.
        </p>

        <h4>Discrete Distribution Simulation:</h4>
        <p>
          Discrete distributions model outcomes where data points take on
          distinct, separate values. In the script, a simulation of the Poisson
          distribution exemplifies a discrete distribution. The Poisson
          distribution is commonly used to model the number of events occurring
          within a fixed interval of time or space.
        </p>

        <h4>Continuous Distribution Simulation:</h4>
        <p>
          Conversely, continuous distributions model outcomes where data points
          can take on any value within a given range. The simulation of the
          normal distribution (Gaussian distribution) in the script is an
          illustration of a continuous distribution. Continuous distributions
          are characterized by smooth, unbroken curves and are often used to
          model variables such as height, weight, or temperature.

        <h4>Statistical Distributions Simulation:</h4>
        <p>
          The accompanying plot visually demonstrates the simulated continuous
          and discrete distributions, emphasizing their distinct
          characteristics. The subplot on distribution properties adds a layer
          of understanding regarding the statistical measures associated with
          these distributions.
