        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          "Online" algorithms designed for data streams are crucial in scenarios
          where data arrives continuously and cannot be stored entirely in
          memory. These algorithms process incoming data on-the-fly, making
          real-time decisions and updating their estimates as new information
          becomes available. Exploring the concepts and code behind online
          algorithms unveils innovative strategies for efficient and dynamic
          data processing.
        </p>

        <h4>Online Mean Estimation:</h4>
        <p>
          One fundamental online algorithm is the online mean estimator. This
          algorithm updates its mean estimate as each new data point in the
          stream arrives, providing a continuous and adaptive measure of the
          data's central tendency. The accompanying Python script demonstrates
          the implementation of an online mean estimator applied to a simulated
          data stream.
        </p>

        <h4>Visualization of Online Mean Estimation:</h4>
        <p>
          The resulting plot illustrates how the mean estimate evolves over time
          as new data points are processed. The red dashed line represents the
          true mean, while the blue line depicts the online mean estimate. This
          dynamic visualization offers insights into how the algorithm adapts to
          changing data patterns and provides an estimate that converges to the
          true mean.
        </p>

        <h4>Practical Significance:</h4>
        <p>
          Online algorithms are particularly valuable in scenarios where data
          arrives continuously or in large volumes. Their real-time processing
          capabilities make them suitable for applications such as monitoring
          systems, financial data analysis, and network traffic management. The
          trade-off between computation and memory efficiency makes online
          algorithms a powerful tool in handling streaming data.

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>
          Exploring online algorithms for data streams sheds light on innovative
          approaches to dynamic and continuous data processing. As we encounter
          increasingly large and diverse datasets, the adaptability and
          efficiency offered by online algorithms become essential for
          extracting meaningful insights and making timely decisions in various
          domains.
