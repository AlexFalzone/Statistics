        <h2>Sample Space (Ω)</h2>
        <p>
          The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random
          experiment. It is denoted by Ω (omega). For example, if you roll a
          six-sided die, the sample space would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa">
        <h2>Event Space (F)</h2>
        <p>
          The event space is a collection of subsets of the sample space,
          representing possible events or combinations of outcomes. It is
          denoted by F. For the six-sided die example, an event might be
          "rolling an even number," and its corresponding subset could be {2, 4,
          6}.
        </p>

        <h2>Probability Measure (P)</h2>
        <p>
          The probability measure assigns a probability to each event in the
          event space, satisfying certain axioms. It is denoted by P. The
          probability of an event A is written as P(A). The probabilities must
          satisfy the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>P(A) is non-negative for every event A.</li>
          <li>P(S) = 1, where S is the entire sample space.</li>
          <li>
            For any sequence of mutually exclusive events A1, A2, ..., the
            probability of the union of these events is the sum of their
            individual probabilities: P(A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ...) = P(A1) + P(A2) + ...
          </li>
        </ul>
