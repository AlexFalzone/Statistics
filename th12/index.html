        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>
          Itô Integration and Calculus form a fundamental part of stochastic
          calculus, a branch of mathematics dealing with processes containing a
          stochastic (random) component. It extends traditional calculus to
          accommodate the analysis of processes involving random movements, such
          as financial asset prices.
        </p>

        <h4>Concept:</h4>
        <p>
          The Itô integral is an extension of the Riemann integral to handle
          stochastic processes. It considers the limit of sums of random
          variables, incorporating both the values of the process and the
          stochastic increments. The Itô calculus provides rules for
          differentiating and integrating stochastic processes, essential in
          modeling the evolution of random phenomena.
        </p>

        <h4>Didactical Simulations:</h4>
        <p>
          The Python script simulates the Itô integral, showcasing the
          cumulative effect of stochastic increments over time. This simulation
          helps visualize the concept of integrating a stochastic process,
          providing an intuitive understanding of the Itô integral.
        </p>

        <h4>Practical Significance:</h4>
        <p>
          Itô Integration and Calculus are crucial in the modeling of financial
          derivatives, where prices are influenced by random factors. It has
          applications in mathematical finance, physics, and various fields
          where the dynamics of uncertain processes are of interest.

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>
          Simulating Itô Integration and Calculus offers a practical
          demonstration of how stochastic processes are integrated over time.
          This mathematical framework is foundational in understanding and
          modeling random processes, particularly in the realms of finance and
          physics.
