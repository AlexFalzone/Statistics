        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Stochastic processes and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are
          fundamental concepts in the field of probability and mathematical
          finance, providing mathematical models to describe random phenomena
          evolving over time. Exploring the simulation of stochastic processes
          offers valuable insights into the dynamics and uncertainties inherent
          in various real-world scenarios. The accompanying Python script
          employs the Euler-Maruyama method to simulate one such stochastic
          process â€“ the geometric Brownian motion.

        <h4>Visualization of Geometric Brownian Motion:</h4>
        <p>
          The resulting plot illustrates the trajectory of the simulated
          geometric Brownian motion over time. The stochastic nature of the
          process is evident as the path evolves, showcasing the characteristic
          random fluctuations inherent in such processes. The Euler-Maruyama
          method provides a numerical approach to capturing the continuous-time
          evolution of the stochastic process through discrete-time simulations.

        <h4>Practical Significance:</h4>
        <p>
          Stochastic processes and SDEs find applications in various fields,
          including finance, physics, biology, and more. Understanding and
          simulating these processes enable researchers and practitioners to
          model and analyze complex systems subject to random influences. The
          geometric Brownian motion, in particular, has wide-ranging
          implications in financial modeling and risk management.

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>
          Exploring the simulation of stochastic processes provides a valuable
          foundation for understanding the behavior of random systems. As we
          delve into the complexities of dynamic and uncertain phenomena, the
          application of stochastic processes and SDEs becomes increasingly
          relevant for making informed predictions and decisions in diverse
          scientific and financial domains.
