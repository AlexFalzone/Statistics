          Question 1: What is Statistics and its relationship with other
          disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential
          Statistics.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Statistics:</strong> Statistics is a mathematical discipline
          that involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation,
          and organization of data. Its primary purpose is to make sense of
          complex and often vast data sets in order to draw meaningful
          conclusions and make informed decisions. Statistics plays a crucial
          role in various fields and has a strong relationship with several
          other disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Relationship with Other Disciplines:</strong> Statistics is
          closely interconnected with various fields such as mathematics,
          economics, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. It
          provides essential tools for researchers, scientists, and
          professionals to analyze data and test hypotheses. Its application is
          widespread, ranging from scientific research and market analysis to
          quality control and public policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics:</strong>
          Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics are two fundamental
          branches of statistical analysis:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Descriptive statistics
            involve summarizing and organizing data to describe its key
            features. This branch focuses on measures like central tendency
            (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation,
            range), and graphical representations (histograms, bar charts, pie
            charts) to provide a clear and concise overview of the data.
            Descriptive statistics help in understanding the data's
            characteristics, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Inferential statistics, on
            the other hand, goes beyond the mere description of data. It is
            concerned with making inferences or predictions about a population
            based on a sample from that population. This involves the use of
            probability theory and hypothesis testing. Inferential statistics
            allows us to draw conclusions and make generalizations about a
            population, using sample data. Common techniques in inferential
            statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and
            regression analysis.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In summary, statistics is a foundational discipline that collaborates
          with a wide range of other fields to provide valuable insights from
          data. Descriptive statistics provides a summary of data
          characteristics, while inferential statistics allows us to make
          informed decisions and draw conclusions about populations based on
          sample data, all of which are integral to scientific research and
          decision-making processes in various domains.

          Question 2: Describe the concepts of Population, Sample Attribute,
          Variable, Level of measurement and Dataset.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Population:</strong> The population is the entire group of
          individuals, items, or events under study. It is the complete set that
          you want to draw conclusions about. In statistical analysis, the
          population represents the larger group from which a sample is drawn.
          The characteristics of the population are of primary interest in many
          research studies.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Sample:</strong> A sample is a subset of the population. It is
          a smaller group selected from the population to represent the whole.
          Sampling is often used because it is impractical or impossible to
          study an entire population. A well-constructed sample should be
          representative of the population, ensuring that the data collected can
          be generalized to the entire group.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Attribute:</strong> An attribute is a characteristic or
          quality of interest that is being measured or observed within the
          context of a study. Attributes can be categorical or quantitative. For
          example, in a study of individuals, attributes could include gender,
          age, income, and education level. Attributes are essential in defining
          variables and collecting data.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Variable:</strong> A variable is a specific measurement or
          observation associated with an attribute. Variables can take on
          different values and can vary among the individuals or items being
          studied. They can be categorized as dependent (responding to changes)
          or independent (manipulated) in research. Variables can also be
          classified as categorical (nominal or ordinal) or quantitative
          (interval or ratio) based on their characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Level of Measurement:</strong> The level of measurement
          indicates the scale or type of data a variable provides. There are
          four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
          Nominal data represents categories or names, ordinal data has a
          specific order, interval data has equal intervals but no meaningful
          zero point, and ratio data has equal intervals with a meaningful zero
          point. The level of measurement determines the mathematical and
          statistical operations that can be performed on the data.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Dataset:</strong> A dataset is a collection of data organized
          into a structured format. It typically includes multiple variables,
          and each observation or record represents a data point. Datasets can
          be used for analysis, research, and generating insights. In the
          context of statistics, datasets are essential for applying various
          statistical techniques and making informed decisions based on the
          data.

        <h3>Question 3: Briefly describe the main sampling methods</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Simple Random Sampling:</strong> This method involves
          selecting a sample from a population in such a way that every
          individual or item has an equal chance of being chosen. It's often
          done using random number generators or drawing lots. Simple random
          sampling is widely used and provides an unbiased representation of the
          population.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Stratified Sampling:</strong> In stratified sampling, the
          population is divided into subgroups or strata based on certain
          characteristics (e.g., age, gender). A random sample is then drawn
          from each stratum. This method ensures that each subgroup is
          represented in the sample, making it useful when there are known
          variations within the population.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Systematic Sampling:</strong> Systematic sampling involves
          selecting every nth item from a list or sequence. The starting point
          is chosen randomly. It's an efficient method when there is a clear
          order or sequence in the population, such as items on a production
          line or students in a class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Cluster Sampling:</strong> In cluster sampling, the population
          is divided into clusters or groups, and then a random selection of
          clusters is made. All individuals within the chosen clusters are
          included in the sample. Cluster sampling is useful when it's
          challenging or expensive to access individual elements of the
          population.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Convenience Sampling:</strong> Convenience sampling is a
          non-probabilistic method where the sample is chosen based on what is
          convenient or readily available. While it's quick and easy, it may not
          represent the population accurately and can introduce bias.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Snowball Sampling:</strong> Snowball sampling is often used in
          studies involving hard-to-reach or hidden populations, like drug users
          or marginalized groups. One initial participant is selected, and they
          refer additional participants, creating a "snowball" effect. It's
          useful for accessing populations that are not easily enumerated.

        <h3>Question 4: Briefly describe the main experiment designs</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):</strong> Subjects
          randomly assigned to experimental or control groups to assess the
          effect of an intervention.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Pre-Post Design:</strong> Measures subjects before and
          after an intervention to evaluate changes within the group.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Cross-Sectional Design:</strong> Collects data from a
          diverse group at a single time point to examine relationships between
          variables.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. Longitudinal Design:</strong> Tracks the same subjects over
          time to analyze changes and trends.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>5. Factorial Design:</strong> Manipulates multiple variables
          to study their combined effects.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>6. Quasi-Experimental Design:</strong> Studies with variable
          manipulation but no random assignment to establish causal
          relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>7. Case-Control Design:</strong> Compares cases with a
          condition to controls without it to identify causal factors.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>8. Cohort Design:</strong> Follows a specific group (cohort)
          over time to track changes and outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>9. Single-Subject Design:</strong> Focuses on a single
          subject's behavior or responses over time.
