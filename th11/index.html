        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>
          Donsker's Invariance Principle is a key result in probability theory,
          extending the Central Limit Theorem to function spaces. It states that
          certain functionals of random processes, specifically empirical
          distribution functions (ECDFs) in the case of independent and
          identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, converge to a
          Gaussian process as the number of observations increases.
        </p>

        <h4>Proof:</h4>
        <p>
          The proof involves establishing tightness of the sequence of empirical
          processes and showing that the limiting process is a mean-zero
          Gaussian process with a covariance structure determined by the
          underlying distribution. The result has applications in non-parametric
          statistics and econometrics.
        </p>

        <h4>Simulation of Donsker's Invariance Principle:</h4>
        <p>
          The script simulates Donsker's Invariance Principle by
          generating multiple ECDFs from i.i.d. uniform random variables. The
          average ECDF converges to a limiting process, illustrating the
          convergence to a Gaussian process as predicted by the invariance
          principle.
        </p>

        <h4>Practical Significance:</h4>
        <p>
          Donsker's Invariance Principle is foundational in the understanding of
          the behavior of non-parametric statistical procedures. It provides a
          bridge between empirical processes and Gaussian processes,
          facilitating the analysis of statistical functionals and their
          asymptotic behavior.

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>
          Simulating Donsker's Invariance Principle offers a visual
          demonstration of the convergence of empirical distribution functions
          to Gaussian processes. This powerful result extends the reach of the
          Central Limit Theorem to function spaces, enhancing our understanding
          of the asymptotic behavior of statistical functionals.
