        <h3>The Wiener Process (Brownian Motion):</h3>
        <p>
          The Wiener process, or Brownian motion, is a continuous-time
          stochastic process that exhibits random motion. It has stationary,
          independent increments, and is widely used in various fields,
          including physics and finance. The script simulates the Wiener process
          using random increments sampled from a normal distribution.
        </p>

        <h4>Derivation of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM):</h4>
        <p>
          The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic
          process that extends the Wiener process. It serves as a fundamental
          model for describing the evolving value of financial assets. The
          equation for GBM is given by:
        </p>

        <blockquote> d洧녡<sub>洧노</sub> = 洧랞洧녡<sub>洧노</sub>dt + 洧랥 洧녡<sub>洧노</sub>d洧녥<sub>洧노</sub></blockquote>

        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>洧녡<sub>洧노</sub> is the value of the process at time 洧노,</li>
          <li>洧랞 is the drift or expected rate of return,</li>
          <li>洧랥 is the volatility or standard deviation of the returns,</li>
          <li>洧녥<sub>洧노</sub> is a Wiener process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This equation represents the differential form of GBM, capturing the
          instantaneous rate of change in the asset's value. The derivation
          involves utilizing the properties of the Wiener process and
          integrating to obtain the final expression.
        </p>

        <h4>Simulation of Wiener Process and GBM:</h4>
        <p>
          The Python script simulates both the Wiener process and the GBM. The
          Wiener process represents the random motion, while the GBM extends
          this concept to model the evolving value of a financial asset. The
          resulting plot illustrates the simulated paths of both processes over
          time.
        </p>

        <h4>Practical Significance:</h4>
        <p>
          The Wiener process and GBM are fundamental in financial modeling,
          where GBM is often used to describe the price movement of financial
          instruments such as stocks. Understanding and simulating these
          processes contribute to the development of models for pricing options,
          risk management, and portfolio optimization.

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>
          Simulating the Wiener process and GBM provides a practical insight
          into the behavior of stochastic processes in continuous time. These
          processes serve as foundational concepts in financial mathematics and
          are crucial for understanding the dynamics of random phenomena in
          diverse fields.
