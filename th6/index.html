        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The generation of random variates is a critical aspect of many
          statistical simulations and modeling scenarios. This process involves
          algorithms designed to produce numbers with specified probability
          distributions. Exploring the algorithms for random variates generation
          unveils the methods that underpin statistical simulations, providing a
          bridge between theoretical distributions and practical applications.
